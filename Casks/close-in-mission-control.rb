  caveats <<~EOS
    #{token} is not notarized by Apple, so macOS blocks its first launch.
    Open it once, then allow it in System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway,
    or run:
      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "#{appdir}/Close in Mission Control.app"

    It then asks for Accessibility access, which it needs to work.
